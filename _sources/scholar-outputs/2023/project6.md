Heatwaves are extreme deviations from the average temperature over a period, usually three to seven days. Heatwaves are a direct implication of global climate change. Heatwaves directly impact people's lives. As most of South-east Asia is developing, the socio-economic repercussions of heatwaves are immense in the region.

Hence, It is essential to quantify the intensity and severity of heatwaves to understand the relative levels of present and projected risk. Using CMIP6 models for historical and future scenarios, we intend to assess the trend in heatwaves. Using different projections from shared socio-economic pathways (SSP) such as SSP 585, SSP370, and SSP 245, we can see how the heatwaves differ in the region. A heatwave duration index may be used to analyse the heatwave characteristics. The expected increase in heatwaves will further be associated with the variation in carbon dioxide levels in the region. The analysis will also help identify critical zones within the region. The heatwave risk assessment will serve as a precursor for further risk mitigation strategies.
