# Climatematch Impact Scholars Program

The Climatematch Impact Scholars Program allows aspiring climate scientists to continue and expand on the research project they started during [Climatematch Academy: Computational Tools for Climate Science](https://comptools.climatematch.io/tutorials/intro.html). 

In line with the [mission of Climatematch](https://academy.climatematch.io/about/mission), the program aims to:
- advance the scholars' **computational research skills and knowledge** in a specific sub-domain of climate science,
- help the scholars chart their path **from data to action**.
