# Presentation guidelines

## Session format
Each [seminar session](./seminar_presentations.md) will feature 3-4 teams of Impact Scholars. 

Every team will deliver a **10-minute talk** followed by a moderated Q&A. 

The last 30 minutes of each session will be dedicated to networking between the scholars and scientists from our collaborating organizations, [CMIP](https://wcrp-cmip.org/) and [LEAP](https://leap.columbia.edu/). 

The presentation part of each session will be open to the public and recorded. Recordings will be made available on the [Climatematch Academy Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ClimatematchAcademy-uq9vr/videos) and the [program website](https://programs.climatematch.io/impact-scholars/scholars2023.html) soon after the events.

## Specific presentation requirements
- talks should be **10 minutes** long
- groups should **mention the data** they used in their projects and include a slide about their **experience working with the data** (what did you find helpful? what did you struggle with?)
- groups using CMIP data should add the **CMIP logo** to their presentations (you can get a high resolution logo [here](https://wcrp-cmip.org/branding/))
