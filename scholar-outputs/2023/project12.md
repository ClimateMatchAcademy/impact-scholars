Crop production in Colombia and Indonesia is primarily carried out by small, family-owned farms, contributing significantly to job creation in rural areas. The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is pivotal in influencing rainfall, flooding, drought, and heat waves in both countries. These ENSO-related weather anomalies substantially affect crop production and farmers' livelihoods. Coffee production plays a key role in the agricultural economy of both the countries and droughts and ENSO events might impact coffee production in future.
<br>
<br>
This research aims to delve into the varied impacts of El Niño events on temperature and rainfall patterns, thereby affecting vegetation and coffee production in Colombia and Indonesia.
<br>
<br>
To assess the ENSO events, ONI and Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) were used to identify the El Niño events and the regional drought. SPI was calculated from ERA 5 precipitation data for 3, 6, 12 and 24 months rolling period. There is a notable correlation between temperature raising and observed drought periods in Indonesia and Colombia (SPI less than -1) with the positive anomalies in the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI). This knowledge will serve as a valuable foundation for devising effective strategies to mitigate the adverse effects stemming from climate change.

With the aim of identifying the possible El Niño events in the future, firstly the comparison of different CMIP6 models sea surface temperature data with the historical data.
