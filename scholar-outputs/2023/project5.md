The Argentinian Andean-Patagonian Forest (AAPF) is a highly biodiverse temperate forest in South America. This area is being threatened by the intensification of climatic conditions that favor the occurrence of fires. However, assessing AAPF fire events is challenging due to a high climatological, geographic and ecosystem variability. Previous analyses were specific and did not consider the latitudinal difference in fire occurrence. In this study, satellite derived data was used to analyze burned areas in AAPF during the 2001-2020 period, and explained its variability in the latitudinal dimension. Two key fire-affected subregions were identified, highlighting the northern AAPF as the most impacted. The study revealed the intricate relationship between fire events and climatic and geographic variability. This assessment serves as a basis for future research on climate change impacts and fire risk prediction in AAPF, emphasizing the need for informed conservation strategies in this biodiverse and ecologically significant region.
